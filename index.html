                        Hassle-free registration of ownership using DLT technology
                    </div>
                    <button class="button">How it works</button>
                    <div class="hidden_explanation">
                        <p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is way to store information in tamper proof way with exact unchangable timestamp in popular distributed ledgers:
                            bitbocin blockchain, ethereum blockchain or private blockchains (distributed ledgers).
                        </p>
                        <p>First digital fingerprints is created from your image. Then they are stored on most popular blockchains: bitcoin blockchain, ethereum blockchain,
                        and in our private database. Two fingerprints are created. First allows to identify your image uniquely and second is for searching
                        for similar images. Once you have your unique image identifier, it is stored on blockchain together with your name and your digital signature.
                        If you haven't digital signature, it is generated by us.</p>
                        <p>Once data is saved, it gets timestamped. And as blockchain is tamper-proof
                        and could not be reversed or changed and also provides exact time when data was added to it as well as identifier of person who added, you can
                        use this data as verifiable proof that <b>in this moment of time this image with this unique id existed</b> and was added by <b>this author</b>.
                        This could be treated as publishing in well-known public source and proves your initial ownership over image based on precenence basis: first who published
                        image in public is its owner.</p>
                        <p>After registration on blockchains you get certificate with all necessary data to prove your authorship which could be used even without our service</p>
                        <p><b>What will happen if someone will stole your photo and register it over this technology before you?</b><br>
                            In depends on what other evidences you have. The same situation as if someone stole your photo and registered it in US copyright office as its own.<br>
                            If your photo was never published anywhere, you'll need to use your other evidences of ownership - raw images with timestamp or unveil image published in some source.<br>
                            If your photo was already published, our service (as well as US copyright office) will not regisgter it if photo could be found online.<br>
                            In case you register your photo with our service but don't publish and someone steal it and register again, he'll got timestamp in later time. So as you
                            have certificate with timestamp earlier in time, you're legal owner. But even more, we'll try our best not to allow registering duplicates over our service
                        </p>
                        <p><b>What will happen if you sell image to someone so she is now legal owner of image and copyright owner</b><br>
                        Its totally ok and normal situation. You still be treated as author and your certificate with blockchain-timestamped data will confirm it.
                        While new owner will have its own document confirming his right for image. But you are still author of it. And new owner won't be able
                        to register image using our service as "author" because you registered and have certificate with timestamp in past.</p>

                        <p>In case it is not, you can file up a takedown notice to the site with request to remove infrigement and providing our certificate</p>

                            remove infiging photo. You can use certificate we produce for your image as evidence of your ownership. We help with filling such

                        </p>
                        <p>Watermarks which small changes in photo could be visible like your name in the corner. They can also be invisible and even withstand some
                            image modifications. So when checked with special tool, it reveals your copyright or your ownership or your authorship over a photo
